These Matlab functions perform the numerical inversion of a symbolic expression representing a Characteristic function of a discrete/continuous distribution, and outputs the discrete/continuous CDF over a custom range.

- example_discrete.m : Script demonstrating how to use the function for discrete RVs
- Davies_inversion_continuous.m : Function performing the inversion for continuous RVs

 It needs the Matlab (R) Symbolic Toolbox. Tested on Matlab r2016b and r2017b.
